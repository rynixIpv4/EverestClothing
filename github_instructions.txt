To push your existing EverestClothing repository to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.com (do NOT initialize it with README, license, or .gitignore)

2. After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EverestClothing.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3. If you haven't authenticated with GitHub before, you'll be prompted to sign in.

4. If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS, you can use this command instead:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/EverestClothing.git

After successful push, you can verify your repository is available at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EverestClothing
